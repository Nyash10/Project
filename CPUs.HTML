    <h1>CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT(S)(CPU(s))</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is a CPU?</h2>
    <p>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. 
        The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. 
        This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).
        The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged. 
        Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic–logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory), decoding and execution (of instructions) by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components.</p>

    <h3>Types of CPUs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Single-Core CPU: It is the oldest type of CPU which is available and employed in most of the personal and official computers. The single-core CPU can execute only one command at a time and its not efficient in multi-tasking</li>
        <li>Dual-Core CPU: It is a single CPU that comprises of two strong cores and functions like dual CPU acting like one. Unlike the CPU with a single core, the processor must switch back and forth within a variable array of data streams and if or more thread is executed, the dual-core CPU manages the multitasking effectively.</li>
        <li>Quad-Core CPU: The quad-core CPU is a refined model of multiple core CPU features and design with four cores on a single CPU. Similar to dual-core CPU, that divides the workload in between the cores, and quad-core enables for effective multitasking. It doesn’t signify any single operation which is four times faster rapid than others.</li>
        <li>Hexa-Core CPU: It is another multiple core processor which is available with six cores and can execute the task which works rapidly than the quad-core and dual-core processors. For users of the personal computer, the processors of Hexacore is simple and now the Intel is launched with Inter core i7 in 2010 with Hexa core processor.</li>
        <li>Octa-Core CPU: The dual-core is built with two cores, four cores are built-in quad-core, Hexa comes with six cores where the octa processors are developed with eight independent cores to execute an effective task that is efficient and even acts rapidly than quad-core processors.</li>
        <li>Deca-Core CPU:The processor with double core comprises two cores, 4 cores are available with quad cores, six cores are available in hexacore processors. Deca-core is available with ten independent systems that are deployed to execute and manage the task that is successful than other processors that are developed until now.</li>
